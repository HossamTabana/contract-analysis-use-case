## Findings:

### Conflicts:
- Digital Cinema's clause provides a comprehensive disclaimer of all warranties including implied ones. In contrast, Cybergy Holdings' clauses specify responsibilities for warranties made by its representatives and provide conditions under which the warranties apply.

### Similarities:
- Both companies limit their liability concerning warranties, explicitly disclaiming any express or implied warranties outside the specified clauses.

### Differences:
- The structure of the disclaimers differs; Digital Cinema uses an "as-is" clause while Cybergy Holdings specifies conditions under which the technology must operate correctly.
- Cybergy's clauses include specific requirements for obligations concerning warranties, which Digital Cinema's clause does not.

This report encapsulates the analyzed findings of warranty clauses from both companies and references specific materials for further investigation.
