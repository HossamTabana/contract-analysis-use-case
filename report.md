### Analysis of Findings

1. **Similarities**:
   - All three clauses include disclaimers regarding warranties, emphasizing that no express or implied warranties are made beyond what is explicitly stated.
   - Each clause contains language that disclaims any liability for issues such as errors, omissions, or unfulfilled expectations from the services or products provided.

2. **Differences**:
   - The **Digital Cinema Destinations Corporation** clause emphasizes a broad disclaimer for all types of warranties and includes implications about performance and reliability.
   - The **Cybergy Holdings, Inc.** clauses highlight the responsibility of MA for any claims or representations made which differ from the established warranties, making the relationship more rigid regarding liability for MA.
   - Cybergyâ€™s clauses specifically mention a time frame (90 days) within which claims must be made, which is not present in the Digital Cinema disclaimer.

3. **Conflicts**:
   - A potential conflict exists regarding liability. In Cybergy's agreement, MA agrees to indemnify Company for any lapse in its own representations, whereas, in Digital Cinema's contract, the responsibility lies more broadly with the NCM and creates ambiguity about where liabilities shift in practice.

This report provides a detailed overview of the analyzed contract clauses and their implications, facilitating informed strategic decisions based on warranty responsibilities and potential liabilities.
